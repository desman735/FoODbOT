# FoODbOT
##Description:
This bot came from the need for knowing how much certain emoji were used. The guild we were in was running out of emoji slots but still had ideas for new ones. This is why the first command we added was to count the emoji one.
To get to know all the emoji available to you use the command character (default !) and help so !help.

##Dependencies:
* python 3.6.7
* discord.py-1.2.5
